# Links 
* * The <a> element creates links. Click on anything from the <a> tag to the </a> tag closure. The page you want to link to is specified with the href attribute.
* * This text is known as link text between the opening tag and closing tag.
* * The value of the href attribute will be the full web if you link to another website,A site address known as an absolute URL. When you link to pages on your own website, relative URLs can be used.
* * You do not need to specify the domain name in the URL if you are connecting to other pages within the same site. A shorthand called a relative URL can be used.This is a shorter version of absolute URLs since the domain name does not have to be specified
* * relative URLs that are a shortcut to tell the browser where the current page is
* mailto
* * You use <a> element to create a link that starts an email program for the user and addresses an email to a given email address. This time the href value begins with mailto: and the email address to which you wish the e-mail is sent is followed.
* target
* * You can use the target attribute on opening tag <a> if you wish to open a link in a new window. The value should be _blank of this attribute.A web page author could like one of the most common reasons for opening a link in a new window, if it points to a different site. In such circumstances, they hope that after looking at the other site the user will return to the window.

## Layout 
* * Every HTML element is treated by CSS like it is in its own box. Either a block box or an inline box is this box. Boxes of the block-level start with a new line and act as the main components of any layout, while inline boxes flow between the text.The width of the boxes allows you to control how much space each box takes. You can use borders, margins, padding and background colors for separating boxes.
* Block-level elements start on a new line
* Inline elementsflow in between surrounding text
* * The CSS features the following layout-checking regimes: normal flow, relative positioning and absolute positioning. The positioning scheme can be specified using the CSS positioning property. The float property can also be used to float elements.
* * You may also have to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top, left, or right a box is to be positioned. 

* * Screen Sizes ,Various visitors to your website will have different screens which display different amounts of information so that the design can work on a variety of different screens
* * Screen Resolution ,The resolution refers to the number of points per inch displayed on the screen. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and users can adjust their screens' resolutions in most operating systems.
* * Page Sizes,web designers often try to create 960-1000 pixel pages (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).
* * Fixed Width Layouts,Control of size and positioning of items with pixel values is accurate.,The designer has much greater control over look and position than liquid layouts of the items on the page. The lengths of the lines of text can be controlled irrespective of the window of the user.
* * Liquid Layouts,Pages are extended to fill the entire browser window so that there is no large screen space around the page.
If the user has a small window, the page can be set up without the user scrolling to the side.Setting the font sizes larger than the intended designer is tolerant to users 

### Functions, Methods, and Objects

* * Functions allow you to group a number of statements to perform a particular task together. You can use the function again if several script parts repeat the same task (rather than repeating the same set of statements).declaration of function  give it a name and write the statements required to complete its task in curly braces. Declare a function using the keyword feature. You give it a name, then put parentheses around it 
* * CALLING A FUNCTION , After declaring the function, you can use only one line of code to execute all of the statements contained within its curly braces.You use the name of the function, followed by brackets to run the code in the function.
* * More than one value can be returned in functions using an array.
* * parameters,like variables to add specific information
* * arguments,When you call a function with parameters, you define the values in the parentheses after the function's name. Arguments are the values that can be given as either values or variables.
* * return ,to return information to code that called

#### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
* *  to  improve the quality of code developers produce
* Iterative loops.
* Code reviews.
* Fast feedback.
* Error checking and linting

* * pairs programming Two developers sharing a single workstation work together to deal with an interactive coding task 
* * The driver is the programmer who types and the only one with keyboard hands,works with mechanics of coding, including the text editor, file switch, version control, writing code.

* * The navigator is looking at the big picture and how to convert an algorithm to code while scanning for typos or bugs. The navigator may also use its computer as a second screen for the search, but should not write code.

* Greater efficiency,It is a common misunderstanding that pair programming takes a long time and is less effective. In fact, it is easier to find errors when two people focus on the same code base,produces higher-quality code,come to a solution faster than one programmer 

*  Engaged collaboration ,the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused,they rely on one another more and often can work together to find a solution without needing any further assistance.

*  Learning from fellow students ,When one developer takes a unique approach to a certain problem, the other developer is presented with a new solution in pair programming.
* Social skills ,Communication is key when you work with someone who has a different coding style. This can get harder if two programmers have different personalities.develop their interpersonal skills

* Job interview readiness,The ability and skilful communication are important (or more!) to work with and learn from others than certain technical know-how for a company.

*  Work environment readiness,Code fellows who already know how to combine work can reach the field of a new job with one less obstacle to be overcome.
