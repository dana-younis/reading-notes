# TEXT

* * HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page , is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets ,an opening tag and a closing tag,Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags
* * They also provide semantic information where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation,carried in elements  semantic markup add extra 
information to the pages 



 ## INTRODUCING CSS
 * * CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
 * * CSS selectors are case sensitive, so they must match element names and attribute values exactly.

 * * Rules are made up of selectors that specify the elements the rule applies to and declarations that indicate what these elements should look like,You can add !important after any property value to indicate that it should be considered more important than other rules that apply to the same element,
 you can create generic rules that apply to most elements and then override the properties on individual elements that need to appear differently
 If you are just creating a single page, you might decide to put the rules in the same file to keep everything in one place,CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page. 


 
 * * CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets, can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.*Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled.*

 * * Declarations are made up of two parts: 
 - the properties of the element that you want to change
 -  values of those properties.



### BASIC JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. 

* * A script is made up of a series of statements. Each 
statement is like a step in a recipe,should end with a semicolon
* * Scripts contain very precise instructions

* * You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code. 

* * variables to store information used in the script.
* * Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.Arrays also have properties and methods that help when working with a sequence of items 
- The sort() method reorders items in an array. 
- The 1 ength property counts the number of items.

* * arrays used to store complex data (including other objects



* * JavaScript distinguishes between 
* numbers (0-9)
* strings (text),
* Boolean values (true or false). 


* * Expressions evaluate into a single value. Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value
* * 
- EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
- EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR 
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A 
SINGLE VALUE

#### DECISIONS & LOOPS 
* * DECISIONS  components
-  An expression is evaluated, which returns a value 
- conditional statement says what to do in a given situatio

Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator. 

* * if statements checks conditions With a series of if statements, they are all checked even if a match has been found (so it performs more slowly than switch).

* * A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match.
