 # HTML lists:
 - ordered ,use numbers , created with  <ol> <li> tags

 - unordered , use bullets , created with the <ul> <li> elements

 - definition ,  to define terminology ,  created with the <dl>  <dt> and <dd> elements.


* *  Lists can be nested inside one another

## Boxes
* * CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box
* * The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are 
* pixels, the most popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size.
* percentages,s relative to the size of the browser window
* ems,the size of the box is based on the size of text within it.

* * It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties The display property allows you to turn an inline element into a block-level element or vice versa, and can also be used to hide an element from the page.
The values this property can take are:
* inline
* block
* inline-block
* none,This hides an element from the page
If the visibility of an element is set to hidden, a blank space will appear in its place



* * Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors. , Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.


* *  Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of 
boxes containing text and the leading.
* * The border property allows you to specify the width, style and color of a border in one property (and the values should be coded in that specific order).
* * You can control the style of a border using the border-styleproperty
* * The border-width property is used to control the width of a border. The value of this property can either be given in pixels

* * CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image 
borders and rounded borders
