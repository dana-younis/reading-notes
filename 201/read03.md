 # HTML lists:
 - ordered ,use numbers , created with  <ol> <li> tags

 - unordered , use bullets , created with the <ul> <li> elements

 - definition ,  to define terminology ,  created with the <dl>  <dt> and <dd> elements.


* *  Lists may be nested within each other.



## Boxes

 * * CSS treats each HTML element as if it were contained within its own box The most popular methods for determining a box's size are:

* Pixels are the most commonly used tool since they allow designers to precisely monitor the size of their designs.

* Percentages are proportional to the browser window's height.

* ems, the box's size is determined by the size of the text it contains.



* * The view and visibility properties can be used to cover objects. You may use the show property to convert an inline element to a block-level element and vice versa, as well as to hide an element from the page.
The following are the possible values for this property: 
* inline
* inline
* block
* inline-block
* none,This hides an element from the page
If the visibility of an element is set to hidden, a blank space will appear in its place


* * Block-level boxes begin on a new line and serve as the basis for any layout, while inline boxes flow between adjacent text. The width of the boxes can be adjusted to control how much space each one takes up (and sometimes the height, too). Borders, edges, padding, and background colors can all be used to differentiate boxes. Inline boxes can be converted to block-level boxes, and block-level boxes to inline boxes.


* *  Legibility the width of text-containing boxes and the leading will help improve legibility. The border property lets you define a border's width, design, and color all in one place (and the values should be coded in that specific order).

The border-styleproperty can be used to monitor the style of a border.

* * The border-width property is used to determine how wide a border should be. This property's value can be expressed in either pixels or bytes.

* * Image development is now possible with CSS3.


### ARRAYS
* * An array is a type of variable that is unique. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 
* * When you don't know how many things a list can contain, arrays come in handy.as a result of the fact that when you build the You do not need to define an array.for a long list you never know when you'll need it,Using just a small portion of the number.

* * The values in an array are accessed in the same way as they would be in a numbered list. It'simportant to note that this list's numbering begins at zero not one

* * A number called an index is automatically allocated to each object in an array. This can be put to good use.his can be used to access specific items in the array.
You can adjust the value of an array object by selecting it and assigning it a new value, just as you can with a variable.as if it were some other variable using the equals symbol and the comma as separators for that object, a new value.
* * A loop would be used if you were to write out all of the objects in an array.


#### USING IF ELSE STATEMENTS
* *  The statements within an if statement must be accompanied by a semicolon, but there is no need for one after the code blocks' closing curly brace.
* * The switch value is the first variable in a switch argument.
Each case specifies a potential value for this variable as well as the code that should be executed if the variable is set to that value.component has the same value as the value.The switch value is expressed by the vector 1 eve l.
* * If none of the cases fit, you have a default choice that is used.â€¢ If a match is found, the code is executed; after that,The break statement halts the remainder of the program.the switch statement is currently active (providing)better results than multiple in the event that declarations)
*  * A unary operator returns a single operand result.You will see an if condition here.checking for the statementthe existence of a material In the event that the When an element is discovered, the end result is truthfully, the initial set of code isTake off. If it isn't found, the next step is to look for it.Instead, the set order is executed.
* * Left to right, logical operators are stored.They short-circuit (stop) as soon as a result is obtained, but they restore the value that caused them to stop.the method (not necessarily true or fa1se).

* * When looping through the items in an array, a for loop is often used.In this case, the results forThe results of each round of a test are saved inscores is an array of numbers.The total number of objects in the collectionA variable is used to store the list.arrayl ength is a name for the length of an array. This is a good example.The number is determined using theThe array's length property.

* * USING WHILE LOOPS,This loop will continue to run as long as the parentheses' condition is valid. That's it.condition is a counter that shows how many times something has happened.

* * USI NG DO WHILE LOOPS,The main difference between a whi 1 e loop and a do whi 1 e loop is that the statements in the do whi 1 e loop are in reverse order.Before the code block, there is a code block.in good condition This implies that those who are Whether or not statements are run once
