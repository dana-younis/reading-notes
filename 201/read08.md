## Layout 
* *  CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout. Inline boxes flow between surrounding text.

* * If one block-level element sits inside another block- level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element. It is common to group a number of elements together inside a di element.

* * Relative positioning is used to control the layout of a page. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property. CSS has the following positioning schemes: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. For more information on CSS positioning click here.

* * Fixed Positioning is a form of absolute positioning. Floating Elements allow you to take an element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box. Floating an element becomes a block-level element around which other content can flow.
