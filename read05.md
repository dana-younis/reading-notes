# Functions
* * It allows you to combine multiple related phrases to form a single task and can also take this information and return a value. * *
## object
* * a series of variables known as *properties of the 
object* and functions known as *methods of the object*
* * Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data 
sets (and both can contain the other). * *
### EVALUATIONS DECISIONS and LOOPS
* * analyze values in  scripts to determine whether or note they match expected results, decistion Using the results of 
evaluations to decide which path your script should go down,LOOPS perform the same 
set of steps repeatedly * *
#### conditional strtement
* *   if then else; if a condition is met, then your code executes one or more statements, else your code does something different * *
* *  if else statement*checks a condition If it resolves to true the first code block is executed. If the condition resolves to false the second code block is run instead*
##### SWITCH STATEMENTS
* * a possible value for the variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value by using switch  default nown as *option that is run if none of the cases match* and case  tag* *

|undefined       | Variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value | 
##### Loops
* *  check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false.* * 
* There are three common types of loops
* FOR , If you need to run code a specific number of times, use a for loop. 
* while ,  you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a while loop. Here the condition can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true. CONDITION
* do while , it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition should run. evaluates to false.
