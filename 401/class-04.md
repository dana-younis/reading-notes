## **Questions**

**Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development**
1. Bugs and faults are often reduced 1.
2. Top Refactor Code is simpler

3. The finishing project is easier since in your testing you "sketch" your final product

**In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?**
You may wish to use beforeEach() and afterEach() to add and delete test data from the database before or after you do the tests when testing CRUD activities with a database.


**What is a downside to Test Driven Development?**
You can put flaws into the test, so your code works when you don't actually want it.

**What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?**
A class defines an instantiated type, while a prototype is an object instance in fact. [source] (https://www.toptal.com/javascript/es6-class-chaos-keeps-js-developer-up)


**Why REST?**
REST is playing with json beautifully. REST isolates the server and storage of data completely from the user interface.


## **Definitions**
**Functional Programming**: a pure functional development technique. Emphasis should be placed on statements and expressions instead than on statements.


**OOP**: a development technique which is focusing on objects with both data and functions.

**class**: a javascript es6 template to make an object


**super**: object inheritance method.


**this**: self-referring object method.


**Driven test development**: a type of programming in which tests are first developed, then written before the code is refactored.

 **Driven test development**:A programming style in which tests are written first, before code, which is then written to pass before being refactored.

**Jest**: a test framework for javascript.

**Continuous integration**: a technique that enables modifications that developers contribute to a common repository to be continuously implemented. It is automatically tested and created every time the code changes.


## **Preview**
Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
- Document databases, NoSQL modelling methods, supergoose testing

Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
- I am forward to learning more about the concepts of NoSQL/non-relational databases, further dive into scheme modularity and learn about big O in whiteboarding.

# SQL and NoSQL—or related and non-relative databases. 
 The difference is how they are constructed, how they store information and how they store it. Relational databases like phone books that record numbers and addresses are structured. They are structured. Non-relation databases, such folders containing everything from a person's address, telephoning number, Facebook preferences and online purchasing preferences, are document-oriented and distributed».

# NoSQL databases 
are contrasted by many non-functional characteristics, such as scalability, performance, and consistency. This element of NoSQL is extensively-studied both in practice and theory since particular non-functional features are frequently the key rationale for NoSQL adoption and basic conclusions on distributed systems like the CAP theorem apply well to NoSQL systems.


# nosql versus sql
SQL databases are mainly termed as Relational Databases (RDBMS) (RDBMS).
SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.
SQL databases have set schema whereas NoSQL databases offer dynamic schema for unstructured data.
For scalability: In most common scenarios, SQL databases are vertically scalable.


# SQL Database Examples

MySQL Community Edition.

MS-SQL Server Express Edition.

Oracle Express Edition

# NoSQL Database Examples

MongoDB.

CouchDB.

Redis.
