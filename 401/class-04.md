## **Questions**

**Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development**
1. Bugs and faults are often reduced 1.
2. Top Refactor Code is simpler

3. The finishing project is easier since in your testing you "sketch" your final product

**In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?**
You may wish to use beforeEach() and afterEach() to add and delete test data from the database before or after you do the tests when testing CRUD activities with a database.


**What is a downside to Test Driven Development?**
You can put flaws into the test, so your code works when you don't actually want it.

**Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?**
A class defines an instantiated type, while a prototype is an object instance in fact. [source] (https://www.toptal.com/javascript/es6-class-chaos-keeps-js-developer-up)


**Why REST?**
REST is playing with json beautifully. REST isolates the server and storage of data completely from the user interface.


## **Definitions**
**Functional Programming**: a pure functional development technique. Emphasis should be placed on statements and expressions instead than on statements.


**OOP**: a development technique which is focusing on objects with both data and functions.

**class**: a javascript es6 template to make an object


**super**: object inheritance method.


**this**: self-referring object method.


**Driven test development**: a type of programming in which tests are first developed, then written before the code is refactored.

 **Driven test development**:A programming style in which tests are written first, before code, which is then written to pass before being refactored.

**Jest**: a test framework for javascript.

**Continuous integration**: a technique that enables modifications that developers contribute to a common repository to be continuously implemented. It is automatically tested and created every time the code changes.


## **Preview**
Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
- Document databases, NoSQL modelling methods, supergoose testing

Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
- I am forward to learning more about the concepts of NoSQL/non-relational databases, further dive into scheme modularity and learn about big O in whiteboarding.
