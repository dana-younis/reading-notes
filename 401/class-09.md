* What is SQL?
SQL is a language that is meant to enable the query, manipulation and transformation of data from a related database by both technical and non-technical users. Thanks to its simplicity, SQL data bases offer secure and scalable storage for millions of smartphones and websites.




* Relational databases?
A Relational database is a collection of connected tables. The Excel spreadsheets with a certain number of named columns (the attributes or qualities of the table) and a certain number of data rows are identical to each table.



Without rearranging the database tables themselves, this data may be accessed in numerous ways.


Info about items to be represented in the data base is contained in tables. The actual value of an attribute is stored in each column in a table in a particular type of data.

The rows in the table are a collection of the relevant object or entity values. Every row of a table may be identified with the unique identification called the primary key, and rows can be linked with foreign keys between various tables.
