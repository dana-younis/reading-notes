# How to solve problems of programming
A number of basic steps I'll provide you with a basic set of procedures to utilize for any programming algorithm type issue.
Completely twice read the problem. Manually solve the problem with 3 example data sets. The manual steps might be optimized. Write down manual steps as a pseudo-code or remark. Replace the actual code for the remark or pseudo-code. Upgrade the actual code. In Steps 1-3, we should spend up to 70% of our time.
Read the problem two times This is the only major phase. You might even read the problem three or four times.You want the situation to be fully understood. One useful test is if you can tell someone else about the situation or not.
How crucial this step is, I can't overemphasize!You can't solve it if you don't grasp the problem. Don't worry about waste of time here, since the easier the problem is to solve, the better you comprehend.Making sure you work through the examples and understand why the answers for each of them are right, if you have examples along with the issue.

# Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and Youâ€™ll Become 100x More Productive
Many individuals spend most of their time on ineffective and low-quality activities that don't help them achieve their purpose. Many individuals may make a fortune (when they spend their time properly)... but instead, unproductively they give away their time that leaves them sad. The more you spend your time, the more productive you will be in life.

# How to think like a programmer
The meta-skill is problem solving.
We've all had issues. Small and big. It's sometimes quite random how we handle them.This is basically like how you solve (what I did when I began coding), but if you have a system:
Try a way forward.Try another one if that doesn't work.
Repeat step 2 till you luck out if this doesn't work.Look, you luck out occasionally. However, this is the worst manner of solving issues! And the loss of time is enormous.The ideal method is to (a) have and (b) practice a framework.


# 5 Technical whys (sometimes known as 5Y). 
This is an easy, but strong, instrument to rapidly cut through an external problem, so you can deal with it once and for all. It reveals its fundamental reasons. (External site links.)
How can I use the 5 
1.Come together a team
2.Set the issue
3.Ask the "Why" first?
4.Ask the question "Why?" Four Times More
5.Want to Stop
6.Root Cause Address (s)
7.Check your actions

# The Super Mario Effect
Focussing on the princess and not on the pit, sticking to a task and learning more, the Super-Mario effect is discussed. The beauty of the Super Mario Effect is to release us from failure anxiety. It's learning from the failures, but it's not concentrating, since failing to do so at the past level doesn't imply you quit up.
