## How do bearer tokens work?  
- The Authentication server generates the Bearer Token for you. When a user logs in to your application (client), the authentication server creates a token for you.

- The Bearer Token is often an obfuscated value generated by the authentication server. It isn't generated at random; it is determined by the user who grants you access and the client to whom your application is granted access.
Bearer Token A security token with the property that any party in possession of the token (a "bearer") can use the token in any way that any other party in possession of it can. Using a bearer token does not require a bearer to prove possession of cryptographic key material (proof-of-possession).

-To get an access token, submit this bearer token along with your client id to the Authentication server. The server will know that the application utilizing the bearer token is the same as the one for which the bearer token was generated.
## Describe express middleware  
Express middleware are functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the Express server. Each middleware has access to the HTTP request and response for each route (or path) it's attached to. In fact, Express itself is compromised wholly of middleware functions.
