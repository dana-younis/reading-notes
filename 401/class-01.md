## describe array.map()
Method is Array.map. One method is an algorithm based on an object called an Array in this example. The array is usually a sequential list of values in the memory.

Consider a distributor, which itself is like an Array an abstract form of data. You can get the item back with change once you've inserted money or selected the item. Now, what is special is that the distributor is not special about the implementation of these procedures.
Like a distributor, Array is an example of an abstract kind of data. It defines its operations, there is no question of how and why you employ them. One of these techniques happens to be Array.map().

The particular function of Array.map() is to provide the items in the list, to perform some sort of algorithms each, and to give a new list of results.
## Simple English Array.reduce().
Now we have a workable method specification. We're going to proceed to another handy array operation: array.reduce ().
Same as in the case of array.map, you should decrease the trips over each of the elements on the list, and you should use an algorithm on each element. Here's another operative term.

What distinguishes array.reduce from other techniques is that its output is relatively loose. It may be whatever sort of information you desire plain, other type of data, boolean, integer, etc.
See both techniques before using the array for some valuable suggestions.
reduce(). Just attempt it as a last way.

## Explain promises
Promises are later fired activities. They help with the development of a delayed and asynchronous calculation. You can prevent requests or code from being blocked.


## Are they all asynchronous callbacks?

No, asynchronous or synchronous callbacks can be. Callbacks are often asynchronous for processing external requests. Callbacks used by methods such as array.forEach are synchronous on the other hand.
