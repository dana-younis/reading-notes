## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

* 1.What is a ‘call’?
Its function invocation.


* 2.How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

* 3.What does LIFO mean?
Last in, first out


* 4.Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

* 5.What causes a Stack Overflow?

***When a recursive function (which calls itself function) without an exit point exists, a stack overflow occurs.***

## JavaScript error messages

* 1.What is a ‘refrence error?
***You get this type of os error when you try to use a variable not yet declared.***


* 2.What is a ‘syntax error’?
***This happens when something cannot be parsed in syntax terms.***


* 3.What is a ‘range error’?
***If you are trying to handle an object with a certain length and give it an invalid length.***


* 4.What is a ‘tyep error’?

***Such types of errors appear when you have incompatible types number, string, and so on such as accessing a property in an undefined variable.***


* 5.What is a breakpoint?
***Its a point in the code, which will make your program stop at that point and help you debugg your code at that point.***



* 6.What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
***It adds a breakpoint to that, and from that point you can step-by-step through your code.***





### Stack Call
* * The call stack is used primarily to call functions (call). Because of the call stack, function(s) are executed from top to bottom, one by one. It means a synchronous call stack.
A call stack is a data framework used to store and manage function invocations temporarily with the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle
