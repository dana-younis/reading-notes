# APIs

## API Design Best Practices
* What does REST stand for?
***REST is an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia. REST is independent of any underlying protocol and is not necessarily tied to HTTP.***


* REST APIs are designed around a _resources.___.


* What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example.
***A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be:***
https://adventure-works.com/orders/1


* What are the most common HTTP verbs?
***GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.***


* What should the URIs be based on?
***URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).***



* Give an example of a good URI.


* What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
***is one that requires consumer to make tremendous (subjective matter) amount of distinct API calls to get needed information about a resource. George Reese has defined chatty API as any API that requires consumer to do more than a single call to perform a single, common operation. its poor quality.***



* What status code does a successful GET request return?

***This means the server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.***

* What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?



* What status code does a successful POST request return?
***The origin server MUST create the resource before returning the 201 status code.***


* What status code does a successful DELETE request return?
***If the delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204***
