# Mongo and Mongoose


***1SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) (RDBMS).NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.***


***2SQL databases are table based databases.NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column storage***


***3.SQL databases have predetermined schema.NoSQL databases feature dynamic schema for unstructured data***


***4.SQL databases are vertically scalable.NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable***


***5.SQL databases employ SQL for data definition and manipulation. SQL (structured query language)Database NoSQL, queries focus on document collection***



# What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
Complex query
# Give a real world example.
MySQL Community Edition
# What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Hierarchical data storage
# Give a real world example.
